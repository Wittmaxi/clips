***Any and all contributions are appreciated and, given that they follow the goals of the clips project, will be accepted.***

You are not required to follow any specific standards, in terms of directory structure or data submission, when contributing to the clips project but the following guidelines will make the inclusion of your code a less painful experience and assist in reaching our goals a quicker.  The guidelines are as follows (using clips/mvf as an example where examples are provided):

1. Each program will have it's own directory disignated as the programs name.  When possible a three letter abbreviation should be used.

2. The directory should contain at least the three files which will be standard for clips.  For example: mvf.cpp, README.md and makefile. Additional files are allowed as needed but these three should be considered the minimum.

3. When commiting you should include an extended description that includes, at minimum, the following information: 
Program name, the GNU Coreutils program it intends to replace (or the new function it is adding that is not present in GNU Coreutils), the programs directory, the programs function, and its current state.  Please see clips/files.md for examples.

4. It is helpful, but not required of you, to give a list of the dependencies, which compiler you are using, and which operating system you are writing on.

5. It is expected that all contributions are written to be portable and OS independent as to reach the maximum number of users.
